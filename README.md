# word_guess_game

A simple word guess game with an Office theme...

It's time for the Dundie Awards. For some reason, even though everyone has worked in the same office for years, Michael has decided name tags are imperative.

You've got 9 guesses to fill in the name tags correctly.

If you get it right, you may just win a Dundie Award of your own. If you're wrong, things are going to get (even more) awkward.

Press any key to get started.
