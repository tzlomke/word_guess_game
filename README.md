# word_guess_game

https://tzlomke.github.io/word_guess_game/

For the University of Denver Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp, students were tasked with creating a hangman-style word-guessing game.

Javascript and jQuery were used extensively to tackle this task. There are two primary functions governing the game, one for each new game and another for the letters chosen by the user.

As the task was relatively simple, my approach from a technical standpoint was to mirror that simplicity with straightforward code. The codebase was kept as DRY as possible with no extraneous code.

Now, here's some silly scene-setting and instructions should you choose to play...

It's time for the Dundie Awards. For some reason, even though everyone has worked in the same office for years, Michael has decided name tags are imperative.

You've got 9 guesses to fill in the name tags correctly.

If you get it right, you may just win a Dundie Award of your own. If you're wrong, things are going to get (even more) awkward.

Press any key to get started.
